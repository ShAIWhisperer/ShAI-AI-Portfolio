## üèÜ My AI-Powered Projects

Here are projects I've built, leveraging generative AI to accelerate development and enhance functionality. These were also contributed to the `CodebuffAI/codebuff-community` showcase.

### ü§ñ [tdd-web-automation](https://github.com/ShAIWhisperer/tdd-web-automation)
A sophisticated web application developed using an AI-driven methodology. This project demonstrates how generative AI tools can be used to rapidly build, test, and deploy robust, production-ready applications.

*   **Key Features:** Full user authentication, real-time form validation, and a detailed test reporting dashboard built with AI-assisted coding.
*   **Tech Stack:** `React`, `TypeScript`, `Playwright`, `Vitest`, `Express`
*   **Highlights:** A showcase of modern development practices, accelerated by AI.

### ‚öôÔ∏è [vending-machine](https://github.com/ShAIWhisperer/vending-machine)
An interactive vending machine developed with the assistance of generative AI. This project highlights rapid prototyping and creative problem-solving by utilizing AI for code generation and designing an engaging, animated web interface.

*   **Key Features:** Inventory management, complex change calculation, and a creative UI with 3D coin rolling effects and product animations.
*   **Tech Stack:** `TypeScript`, `JavaScript`, `CSS`, `HTML`
*   **Highlights:** A fun project demonstrating how AI can augment the creative development process.

## ü§ù Open Source Contributions to the AI Ecosystem

I believe in the power of community and actively contribute to open-source AI projects.

### üêç [mdCrawler](https://github.com/ShAIWhisperer/mdCrawler)
A fork of `JaySym-ai/mdCrawler`, a powerful Python tool designed to supercharge **AI Coding Assistants**. It converts entire documentation websites into clean Markdown, providing essential context for generative AI tools.

*   **My Contribution:** I implemented **Multi-Library Support**, enhancing the tool to process multiple documentation libraries concurrently. This significantly improves its utility for AI agents working in complex, multi-dependency projects.

### üíª [codebuff-community](https://github.com/ShAIWhisperer/codebuff-community)
A fork of the official showcase for projects created by the `CodebuffAI` community. My `tdd-web-automation` and `vending-machine` projects are featured here as examples of AI-assisted development.
